# Midterm Project Report: 

## Introduction

The Boston Police Department (BPD) budget has undergone various changes over the years. This project aims to analyze how the budget is allocated and spent, with a specific interest in overtime pay.

## Figures and Results:

**Takeaways**
- The BPS budget saw approximately 30% increase in 2024.

**Takeaways**
- To identify the areas from which the increase comes, I look at the breakdown of the BPD budget from 2011 to 2024. There are major increases in regular pay, overtime pay, and retro pay.

**Takeaways**
- The BPS budget drop in 2014 is a significant one.
- BPD and BFD both had steady increases in budget, yet BFD did not see a 30% increase like BPD in 2024, as shown in the first figure.
- BPL funding remained relatively low and stable compared to other departments.

**Takeaways**
- BPD has the strongest increasing trend overall and in overtime pay.
- BPP overtime pay amount and rate of increase are also the largest.

## Future Work
- Identifying which overtime events consume the most budget (e.g., court appearances, holidays, Christmas, etc.). Identify other relevant aspects of BPD budget allocation that also see a strong increase (retro pay, etc.) and compare them to other departments.
- **Linear Regression:** Predict the amount of overtime paid for the next year based on historical trends.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** Estimate key parameters related to budget distribution.
- **Clustering Methods:** Identify patterns in overtime spending based on location and event types.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Map incidents to show where the highest concentration of overtime-inducing events occur.
