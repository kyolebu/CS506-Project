# Final Report

### Data preprocessing (since check-in)

- joined the employee earnings report for 2020 with the 2020 Boston Police Department roster on employee name
  - converted hte names into the same format and then used an inner join

### Actual data investigation

- looked into the demographics of the top 10 and top 100 earners
- found that there were disproportionately whtie and male

### Next steps

- still need to build the decision tree about pay level (maybe just focus on overtime pay amount since that is focus of project)
